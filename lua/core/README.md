[Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCwXWOe6VcU)

To be able to run lua files you need to add environment variable to windows with this `core` folder point there.

- Seach in windows `system environment variables` > click on `Environment Variables...` button > System variables > Select `Path` > Edit... > New > Paste the location path to this folder there:
`C:\Users\Maverick\Documents\NEW VIDEO\awesome-cars-gta\lua\core`

- restart code editors and cmd windows
- now when open cmd and write `lua` you should see something like

        Lua 5.4.2  Copyright (C) 1994-2020 Lua.org, PUC-Rio


- run the task > open vs code > `Terminal` > `Run Build Task..` (CTRL+Shift+B )
