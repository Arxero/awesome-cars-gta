# awesome-cars-gta
A FiveM server for GTA, which mainly focuses on free roam, races and random acts of fun between the players in the server and Awesome Cars community.

The main motivation behind it, is to find a better way to enjoy this great game without. the sheer incompetence of Rockstar, to actually some of the main problems I experience while playing GTA online with my friends.

They are as follows:
- loading screen simulator - the range is wide 
    - white, 
    - black, 
    - online joining, 
    - after race, 
    - rockstar launcher loading
- peer to peer connection always has been, awful and it will always be, can't express my frustration when I have to often waste 20 minutes of joining friends sessions, because we keep leaving from current one
- can't really play with randoms cause in literally any lobby there is a modder who would mess around with you and your friends
- bunch of other quality of life improvements and annoyances
    - what is the point of not being able to teleport in the current session, but have to `>` change my spawn point `>` find new session `>` join again the first sesssion - Why?
    - why snacks don't reset when the current mission I am on fails
