CUSTOMIZING CONFIG:
If you want to include additonal models in a list (like props) or overwrite some values in the config
create a new file named *.custom.ini (like props.custom.ini or config.custom.ini) and add new items or
config lines you want to overwrite the original with.
Of course you can modify the original .ini files too, but there is a risk they are gonna get overwritten
by the next mod update.

DEBUG MISSING ITEMS:
In case you missed an item in the config, a debug line "[PocceMod] missing config item: xyz" will warn
you about it in the logs (both server and client side).

PERMISSIONS:
Set up permissions by adding something similar to server.cfg or permissions.cfg (if you have it):
add_principal identifier.steam:your_steam_hex_id group.admin
add_principal identifier.steam:your_steam_hex_id group.moderator
If you have vMenu set up, you probably have this already.
